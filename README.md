# My-projects
Hi,
I'm deeply immersed in learning to code and have a keen interest in data science. My goal is to secure a position as a Data Analyst in 2024. This repository contains various side projects and code snippets that I've enjoyed working on throughout my coding journey.
List of Projects:
1. [FIFA](https://github.com/Chins-10/My-projects/tree/main/FIFA): my solutions to predict a FIFA Winner using some Machine Learning algorithms.
2. [Alzot](https://github.com/Chins-10/My-projects/tree/main/Alzot): An IOT Based Health Care Assistant for Alzheimerâ€™s Patient.
3. [Audio Compression using Wavelets in Matlab](https://github.com/Chins-10/My-projects/blob/main/Audio%20Compression%20using%20wavelets%20in%20Matlab.pdf): Compression of Audio Signal using various techniques in MATLAB.
4. [Machine Learning Projects](): My solutions to understand the machine learning algorithms,classification techniques and many more.
